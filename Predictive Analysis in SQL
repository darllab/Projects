-- Predictive Analysis --

-- The goal of this analysis is to predict whether the future loans should be approved or not --

-- Let's try to answer these following questions --

-- 1. How many loans where approved or not? --

SELECT 
	COUNT(CASE WHEN loan_status = 'Y' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS approved,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN loan_status = 'N' then 1 else NULL END) AS disapproved
from loan_data_1    

-- 2. Does the applicant income affects the application of their loans? --

SELECT applicantincome,
	COUNT(CASE WHEN loan_status = 'Y' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS approved,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN loan_status = 'N' then 1 else NULL END) AS disapproved,
    COALESCE(applicantincome, '10000') AS new_income
FROM loan_data_1
GROUP BY applicantincome
order by applicantincome DESC
LIMIT 10

-- 3. Does the loan amount varies regardless of the applicant income? Does it approved or not? -- 

SELECT applicantincome, loanamount,
	COUNT(CASE WHEN loan_status = 'Y' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS approved,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN loan_status = 'N' then 1 else NULL END) AS disapproved
FROM loan_data_1    
GROUP BY applicantincome, loanamount
LIMIT 10

-- 4. Does the education affects the loan application? --

SELECT education,
	COUNT(CASE WHEN loan_status = 'Y' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS approved,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN loan_status = 'N' then 1 else NULL END) AS disapproved
FROM loan_data_1 
group by education

-- 5. How many self employed were approved their loan or not? --

select self_employed,
	COUNT(CASE WHEN loan_status = 'Y' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS approved,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN loan_status = 'N' then 1 else NULL END) AS disapproved
FROM loan_data_1
group by self_employed

-- 6. What should be the average income for you to approved your loan? --

SELECT 
	COUNT(CASE WHEN loan_status = 'Y' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS approved,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN loan_status = 'N' then 1 else NULL END) AS disapproved,
    AVG(applicantincome) as avg_income
FROM loan_data_1    

-- 7. What should be the average income of your co-applicant for you to approved your loan? --

SELECT 
	COUNT(CASE WHEN loan_status = 'Y' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS approved,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN loan_status = 'N' then 1 else NULL END) AS disapproved,
    AVG(coapplicantincome) AS avg_co_income
FROM loan_data_1   

-- 8. Should you get short term loan or long term loan? -- 

SELECT 
	AVG(loan_amount_term) AS avg_loan_term,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN loan_status = 'Y' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS approved,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN loan_status = 'N' then 1 else NULL END) AS disapproved
FROM loan_data_1
